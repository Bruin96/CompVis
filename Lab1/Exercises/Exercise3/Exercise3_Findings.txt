Test results classical snake:
- The classical snake has a lot of problems with the lower extrema in the image. Even when initialised close to the perceived border of the right lung, it can still fail to find a convincing contour. Only if we practically initialise it on top of the contour does it find the contour. Increasing the blur all the way up to sigma = 4 doesn't help, either, and increase Alpha and Beta can't solve the issue, either.
- For the left lung, it can find the border quite well if it is initialised close to it for sigma = 4. At sigma = 2, it still gets stuck is some local edges corresponding to bronchii. Being slightly far off of the actual border does get the snake into trouble again, however.

Test results GVF snake:
- The snake can fit on the left lung really well by initialising it close to the border of the lung. We do this using sigma = 2. If we initialise it too far outside the left lung, the snake gets stuck on a bump above the left lung, which likely corresponds to the outer border of the torso in the image. By the same token, the process might get stuck when initialised too far from the border of the lung on the inside, since it could get stuck on the gradients corresponding to the bronchii. If we increase the blur to sigma = 3, the fit becomes better. This suggests that the fine detail edges are quite prevalent, and we need to apply a good deal of smoothing in order to be able to find the main borders of the lung. This shows that we need a specific scale  in scale space in order to get the most accurate results. We still need to initialise close to the border in order to find the lung's perimeter.
- The right lung is a bit more difficult. At sigma = 3, the lower edge of the lung is blurred out too much, so that the snake leaks out onto the torso edge. At sigma = 2.5, the fit is quite good, but we still have a thorn sticking out at the lower-left side of the lung where the snake picks up an edge that wasn't smoothed away enough. This thorn doesn't really disappear for any settings we use. We can decrease it by increasing the tension of the snake to Alpha = 0.75 from 0.05, but the side effects of this are that the contour becomes a lot less precise in order areas.
